										<h3>Tangled</h3>
										<h2>Vice President of Experience</h2>
										<h4>User Experience, Front-End Development, Visual Design</h4>
										<h5>2010-2016</h5>
										<h6>Company</h6>
										<p>Tangled was a platform as a service provider that helped entrepreneurs design, build, and launch mobile services. Entrepreneurs could save money and go to market faster because Tangled designed and built iOS and Android mobile apps using its proprietary Person2Person app development platform.</p>
										<div class="details">

												<h6>Background</h6>
												<p>In 2010, four engineers established Tangled to make and sell consumer apps during their free time. In late 2010, I became Tangled's user experience advisor, evaluating the app prototypes. The founders experienced a lot of challenges while building and finding an audience for Tangled's first two Android apps. Then, they stumbled upon a promising opportunity.</p>
												<p>Family, friends, and colleagues consistently asked if Tangled built apps for other people. The common theme was that each person knew someone who had an app idea but did not know how to code. So in 2012, two of the founders decided to pursue the opportunity full time. Tangled pivoted its business model and began designing, building, and launching apps for other entrepreneurs.</p>
												<p>The two founders began building the Person2Person app development platform and acquiring customers for a pilot program.</p>
												<ul>
													<li>In 2012, Tangled acquired the first pilot customer, EPOS, and built the EPOS Android and iOS apps.</li>
													<li>Then in 2013, Tangled acquired the second pilot customer, iDance, and began building the iDance iOS app.</li>
													<li>At the end of 2013, I became a full-time Director of User Experience.</li>
													<li>In 2014, we acquired the third pilot customer, The Spot, but the customer was not ready to build until 2015.</li>
													<li>In late 2014, we also acquired the fourth pilot customer, Decnut, and built both an <a href="http://healthcareinnovation.upenn.edu/kathleen-lee-md" target="_blank">award winning prototype</a> and market ready app for beta testing.</li>
													<li>In 2015, we acquired the fifth pilot customer, The Scene, and began building The Scene iOS iPad app.</li>
													<li>By Q1 2016, we launched the minimum viable products for the Person2Person platform and all 5 pilot customer apps.</li>
												</ul>

										</div>
										<h6>Challenges</h6>
										<p>Tangled was a bootstrapped technology venture with 3 full-time employees from 2013 to 2014, and only 2 full-time employees from 2015 to 2016. We needed flexible processes and time saving tools that grew and adapted along with the business.</p>
										<h6>Responsibilities</h6>
										<p>My main responsibility was to define and implement lean user centered design standards, processes, and tools that decreased the time to market and increased the adoption and usability of iOS and Android mobile apps.</p>
										<p>I architected and built a modular design system for the Person2Person app development platform that reduced the time to design and build user interfaces by 80% over 3 years and ensured a consistent user experience across channels, platforms, and devices.</p>
										<a class="button" href="#tangledp2pheading">Jump to Examples</a>
										<p>I architected the mobile app experience and designed the brand identity for 4 early stage ventures including Decnut, a University of Pennsylvania medical venture which <a href="http://healthcareinnovation.upenn.edu/kathleen-lee-md" target="_blank">won $50K from Ben Franklin Technology Partners</a>.</p>
										<a class="button" href="#idanceappheading">Jump to Examples</a>
										<p>Additionally, I designed Tangled's brand identity. I copy edited and designed Tangled's marketing materials. And, I led the front end development for <a href="http://www.tangledp2p.com" target="_blank">Tangled's responsive website</a>, 3 customer websites (<a href="http://www.eposapp.me" target="_blank">EPOS</a>, <a href="http://www.idanceapplication.com" target="_blank">iDance</a>, and <a href="http://www.thespotnow.com" target="_blank">The Spot</a>), and 5 iOS apps.</p>

											<h6>Overview</h6>
											<p>Tangled Person2Person was an app development platform that reused pre-built modules to design, build, and launch custom iOS and Android apps for customers.</p>
											<p>The key to Tangled's business model was creating apps in a scalable and repeatable way. So I collaborated with the technical architect to implement a modular platform. We agreed to a few standards, namely that the platform parts should be thoughtful, intuitive, consistent, and manageable. Additionally, we defined the process of building customer apps using the module platform. We agreed to extend our Agile Scrum sprint cycle with an Agile UX sprint 0, during which we could use Lean UX methods to plan and design how to use the platform for a customer's app.</p>
											<p>Then, I architected a two part modular design system: a modular user interface library and a customizable theme framework. The user interface library contained standard user interface elements that combined into reusable components, which were used to build layouts. And, the theme framework used variables to globally apply customer branding consistently throughout all user interfaces.</p>
											<p>The design system was so successful that when we acquired the fifth pilot customer, the time to design and build user interfaces was reduced by 80%. My role transitioned to an advisor. And, the iOS developer used the well documented modular design system to quickly implement the app design.</p>

													<h6>A Modular User Interface Library</h6>
													<p>Our main goal was to build the interface from the ground up using fundamental building blocks that can be maintained in one location and reused throughout any app.</p>
													<p>So I led the collaborative design process by leveraging my expertise in requirements analysis, cognitive psychology, and human behavior to make informed decisions about the information architecture, information design, interface design, and navigation design.</p>
													<p>Then, I built the modular user interface components in Adobe Illustrator for high fidelity storyboards, with HTML/CSS for rapid prototypes and web apps, and in XCode for native iOS apps. We planned to build the components in Android Studio when customers were ready to launch native Android apps.</p>
													<p>The user interface library currently contains:</p>
													<ul>
														<li>73 Standard and Custom Elements</li>
														<li>37 Components</li>
														<li>31 Layouts</li>
														<li>Screens</li>
														<li>Storyboards</li>
													</ul>
													<div class="details">

														<label for="uidesign" class="button"></label>
														<div id="uidesignprocess">
															<h6 class="h7">Designing the User Interface Library</h6>
															<ol>
																<li>I collaborated with the technical architect to perform a top down and bottom up analysis of functional and content requirements. During the top down analysis, we identified user interface requirements based on the business strategy and technical architecture. And during the bottom up analysis, we identified the user interface requirements based on universale design principles, iOS and Android human interface guidelines, and common user needs and expectations.</li>
																<li>I distilled the comprehensive functional and content requirements into 73 standard and custom elements, which were the fundamental building blocks for most user interfaces.</li>
																<ul>
																	<h6 class="h8">Content Display Examples</h6>
																	<li>Heading Label, Title Label, Details Label, Metadata Label, View, Avatar, Image, etc.</li>
																	<h6 class="h8">User Input Examples</h6>
																	<li>Button, Icon Button, Hyperlink Button, Text Field, Text View, Check Box, Radio Button, Slider, Stepper, Switch/Toggle, Picker, Spinner, etc.</li>
																	<h6 class="h8">UI Bar Examples</h6>
																	<li>Navigation Bar, Navigation Bar Title, Navigation Bar Buttons, Segmented Control Bar, Segmented Control, Tab Bar, Tab Bar Item Icon, Tab Bar Item Label, Tool Bar, Tool Bar Button Label, Tool Bar Icon Button, Side Menu, Side Menu Button Label, etc.</li>
																</ul>
																<li>I assembled the user interface elements into components that structured and presented content to maximize user understanding. I defined the size, position, spacing, and relationship between elements in the components to create an information hierarchy that guided user action. The following are some principles that guided my design process:</li>
																<ul>
																	<h6 class="h8">White Space</h6>
																	<li>Is there enough white space between and within groups of elements so users do not accidentally trigger an element?</li>
																	<h6 class="h8">Iconic Representation, Picture Superiority Effect</h6>
																	<li>Are images and graphics used as much as possible to capture and retain users' attention?</li>
																	<h6 class="h8">Signal-to-Noise-Ratio</h6>
																	<li>Are only meaningful elements and information displayed?</li>
																	<h6 class="h8">Propositional Density</h6>
																	<li>Are important/meaningful elements larger than unimportant elements?</li>
																	<h6 class="h8">Proximity</h6>
																	<li>Are related elements arranged near each other?</li>
																	<h6 class="h8">Progressive Disclosure</h6>
																	<li>Are complex or low priority elements  hidden until necessary or requested by the user?</li>
																	<h6 class="h8">Chunking and Serial Position Effects</h6>
																	<li>Do groups contain less than 6 values, and are the top and bottom values the most important values for the users' decisions?</li>
																</ul>
																<li>I combined components into layouts, screens, and storyboards that enabled users to efficiently and effectively complete tasks.</li>
																<li>The iOS and Android developers reviewed the user interface library and we all agreed to use standardized names for library elements. Elements were named according to their type and screen position. Components were named according to the types and positions of their child elements. And, layouts and screens were named according to their primary content and function.</li>
																<li>We also agreed to extend the library for high priority content and functionality, which we defined as both integral to Tangled's business model and requested by a reliable customer.</li>
															</ol>
															<p>At the end of the design process, we had a centrally located, extendable user interface library with standardized names and usage guidelines.</p>

													<p>So I led the collaborative design process by leveraging my expertise in cognitive psychology and human behavior to make informed decisions about the visual design.</p>
													<p>Then, I designed and built a customizable theme framework in Xcode for native iOS apps. We planned to build the framework in Android Studio when customers were ready to launch native Android apps.</p>
													<p>The theme framework currently supports:</p>
													<ul>
														<li>2 Fonts and 2 Icon Fonts</li>

															<h6 class="h7">Designing the Theme Framework</h6>
															<ol>
																<li>I collaborated with the technical architect to identify all the customizable user interface elements and their style properties. We decided that customers can select which font families, colors, and icons are used throughout the app.</li>
																<li>I designed a framework using 2 fonts, 9 text sizes, and 12 colors to ensure all app content communicates a visual information hierarchy that helps users quickly process information and complete tasks. The following are some principles that guided my design process:</li>
																<ul>
																	<h6 class="h8">Color</h6>
																	<li>Are colors effectively used to call attention, group interface elements, convey meaning, or enhance aesthetics?</li>
																	<h6 class="h8">Legibility</h6>
																	<li>Are fonts, font sizes, font colors, leading, kerning, alignment, indentation, line height, line spacing, and paragraph before/after spacing consistently used?</li>
																	<h6 class="h8">Desire Line, Wayfinding</h6>
																	<li>Are users visually guided through the desired path of actions?</li>
																	<h6 class="h8">Entry Point</h6>
																	<li>Is there an element that serves as the attentional entry point into the screen?</li>
																</ul>
																<li>I defined the standardized variable names and usage guidelines for fonts, font sizes, and colors. Font variables were named according to their usage. Font size variables were named according to their size. And, color variables were named according to their usage.</li>
																<ul>
																	<h6 class="h8">Example Font Variables</h6>
																	<li>TWCTextHeadingFont should be used to style all heading labels and title labels.</li>
																	<li>TWCTextBodyFont should be used to style all details labels, metadata labels, form field labels, form field values, etc.</li>
																	<li>TWCIconFont should be used to display scalable icons instead of image files (i.e. for tab bar items, navigation bar buttons).</li>
																	<h6 class="h8">Example Font Size Variables</h6>
																	<li>TWCFontSizeXXL should be used to set the size of all icon fonts unless otherwise noted.</li>
																	<li>TWCFontSizeL should be used to set the size of Title labels, Value labels, and Button labels.</li>
																	<li>TWCFontSizeS should be used to set the size of Heading labels and detail labels.</li>
																	<li>TWCFontSizeXS should be used to set the size of Metadata labels.</li>
																	<h6 class="h8">Example Color Variables</h6>
																	<li>TWCColor1 should be used to set the color of the elements that trigger an action (e.g. button backgrounds, checkmarks, navigation bar icons, action icons, and profile card icons).</li>
																	<li>TWCColor2 should be used to set the color of navigation related elements (e.g. navigation bar back button, navigation bar menu icon, tab bar icons and labels, toolbar icons and buttons).</li>
																	<li>TWCColor3 should be used to set the color of the Side Menu Background, Modal Screen Background, and On-Boarding Screens Background.</li>
																	<li>TWCColor4 should be used to set the color of the elements used to alert users (e.g. button or icon).</li>
																</ul>
																<li>The iOS and Android developers reviewed the theme framework and we all agreed to adhere to the usage guidelines and implement the naming standards throughout the design and development process.</li>
															</ol>
															<p>At the end of the design process, we had a customizable theme framework with usage guidelines and standardized variable names that allowed us to globally apply customer branding without changing the underlying platform code for each app.</p>

															<p>Tangled implemented an Agile Scrum sprint cycle with an Agile UX sprint 0. During sprint 0, we  used Lean UX methods to plan and design how to use the platform for a customer's app.</p>
															<ol>
																<li>The customer identified the user problems, defined a hypothesis, and made assumptions to define content and functional requirements.</li>
																<li>Tangled's product owner gathered and organized requirements into high level user stories (epics) and detailed, basic user stories.</li>
																<li>I facilitated a workshop with the customer to explore the users, their goals, and their as-is workflows.

The future workflows were used to gather feedback about the order of user tasks. And, the low fidelity storyboards were used to gather feedback about the information architecture including layouts and navigation.</li>
																<li>I translated the workflows and user stories into high fidelity storyboards for the minimum viable product (MVP). The user interfaces were designed to reuse as much as possible from <a href="#uilibrary">Tangled's modular user interface library</a>.

We designed a relationship management app that provided sponsors with a direct communication channel to students. I architected the Android app experience, and reinterpreted S.O.U.L.'s existing brand identity to style the app. We wrote a proposal and used the proof of concept app to apply for several grants. Additionally, we positioned the app to be part of a Tangled-driven open-source methodology and technology service that other non-profit organizations could use to engage supporters and increase impact, transparency, and accountability.</p>

I also designed and built the home page CSS animation to demonstrate Tangled's value proposition in captivating way.</p>

												<h6>Overview</h6>
												<p>Loka Impact is a technology and environmental literacy curriculum that I created to teach people to engineer and use technology to solve real world problems.</p>
												<p>The first part of the curriculum demonstrates how people engineer technology to solve real world problems. This module helps students build the knowledge and attitudes necessary to solve problems.</p>
												<p>The second part of the curriculum offers students opportunities to engineer technology to solve local community problems. This module helps students gain the capabilities to create and use technology to solve problems.</p>
												<p>And, the third part of the curriculum offers students opportunities to share stories about how they engineered or used technology to solve their local community problems. This module encourages students to exchange knowledge with other people around the world.</p>
												<h6>Influences</h6>
												<p>The curriculum is founded upon the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) best practices and is influenced by the current state of the world. Every person shares common interests such as freedom, security, order, justice, and welfare. And, every person tries to satisfy these common interests by consuming common resources such as natural, economic, social, and human capital resources. Throughout this process, every person faces challenges such as:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>How to manage freshwater resources.</li>
													<li>How to increase agricultural productivity.</li>
													<li>How to trade resources.</li>
													<li>How to reduce crime.</li>
													<li>How to share knowledge.</li>
												</ul>
												<p>Loka Impact aims to help people engineer and use technology to solve these real world problems.</p>
												<h6>Practical Applications</h6>
												<p>The executive director of the S.O.U.L. Foundation asked me to customize the curriculum for her organization. She wanted to build a mobile app to connect Ugandan students with donors and supporters from around the world. She also wanted to implement a technology training program for students and S.O.U.L. staff. So we wrote a proposal and applied for several grants to fund the project. If funded, the project would teach students how to create mobile apps that help their local communities.</p>
